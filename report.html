      <li>What our app does:</li>
      Our app uses a love matchmaking api to determine the percentage chance of love between two people given their names. After that is determined,
      our app provides the user with 5 different quotes about love to encourage the user. The user can sort these quotes alphabetically by authors name
      or length of the quote. 
    </ul>


    <p>How our app satisfies the requirements:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Deploy site - our site is deployed at </li>
      <li>Is Responsive - our site resizes itself depending on the width of view screen</li>
      <li>Uses 2 different APIs - our App uses the Love Calculator API with the Love Quote API</li>
      <li>Has search - On top of our filters, we added a search feature that allows you to search the returned quotes by a keyword. </li>
      <li>Displays results - Our app displays the compatibility percentage along with the returned
        sample love quotes you can try to use.
      </li>
      <li>Results are filterable - Our app can sort Love Quotes alphabetically by author's name or by length of quote, can reset also</li>
    </ul>

    When we went to test our project before turning it in, we realized that the Love Quote API had stopped working on the server side.
    This was after we had typed the report. Because of this, we switched to a different API, but the functionallity of the app 
    was hindered. The code for the original
    app is still there that would meet the requirements for the project.

    Originally, the purpose of the app would show your compatibility with someone and then print out 5 love quotes which could
    be sorted alphabetically, by length, and also by a search bar. These do not work with the new API.
